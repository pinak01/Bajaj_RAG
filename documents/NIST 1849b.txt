Standard Reference Material 1849b 
Infant/Adult Nutritional Formula  I 
(milk -based)  
CERTIFICATE OF ANALYSIS  
 
Purpose:   The certified values delivered by this Standard Reference Material  (SRM) are intended for validating 
methods for determining elements  and vitamins  in infant and adult nutritional formulas and similar materials and for 
quality assurance when assigning values to in -house control materials.  
 
Description:   A unit of SRM  1849b consists of 10 packets, each containing approximately 10 g of material . 
 
Certified Values:   NIST certified values are traceable to  the International System of Units  (SI) derived unit of mass 
fraction, expressed as milligrams per kilogram.   The values are reported on an as -received basis  [1]. 
Table  1.  Certified Values for Various Measurands  in SRM  1849b 
 Mass Fraction(a) 
(mg/kg)   Mass Fraction(a) 
(mg/kg) 
Chromium (Cr)   1.033 ± 0.018   Molybdenum (Mo)   1.741  ± 0.063  
Copper (Cu)   18.96  ± 0.30  Phosphorus (P)  3750 ± 130 
Iodine (I)   2.03 ± 0.19  Selenium (Se)   0.816  ± 0.025  
Iron (Fe)  168.0  ± 7.4    
Magnesium (Mg)   1570  ± 30  Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B 12)  0.0497  ± 0.0046  
 
(a) Values are expressed as x  ± U95%(x), where x  is the certified value and U 95%(x) is the expanded uncertainty of the certified 
value.  The true value of the analyte lies within the interval x ± U95%(x) with 95 % confidence.  To propagate this uncertainty, 
treat the certified value as a normally distributed random variable with mean x  and standard deviation U 95%(x)/2 [2–6]. 
 
Non-Certified Values:   Non-certified values for elements, vitamins, carotenoids, fatty acids, proximates, sugars, other 
nutrients, nucleotides, amino acids, and taurine in SRM 1849b are provided in Appendix A. 
 
Period of Validity:   The certified values delivered by SRM  1849b are valid within the measurement uncertainty 
specified until 31  December  2032 .  The certified values are nullified if the SRM is stored or used improperly, 
damaged, contaminated, or otherwise modified.  
 
Maintenance of Certif ied Values :  NIST will monitor this SRM over the period of its validity.  If substantive 
technical changes occur that affect the certification, NIST will issue an amended certificate through the NIST SRM 
website (https://www.nist.gov/srm ) and notify registered users.  SRM users can register online from a link available 
on the NIST SRM website or fill out the user registration form that is supplied with the SRM.  Registration  will 
facilitate notification.  Before making use of any of the values delivered by this material, users should verify they have the most recent version of this documentation, available through the NIST SRM website ( https://www.nist.gov/srm ).  
 
 
Safety:  SRM  1849b is intended for research use only; not for human consumption.  
 
Storage and Handling:   The original unopened packets of SRM  1849b should be stored at –20 °C or colder.  For 
vitamin  B12, the certification only applies to the initial use and the same results are not guaranteed if the remaining 
powder is used at a later date.  For inorganic constituents, an open packet can be reused until the material reaches its 
expiration date, provided that th e open packet is resealed and stored at – 20 °C or lower.   For all non -certified 
constituents, the value assignment only applies to the initial use as stability in previously opened packets has not been 
evaluated.

Use:   Before use, a packet should be allowed to warm to room temperature, and the contents of the packet should be 
mixed thoroughly by shaking the packet.  Allow the contents  to settle for one  minute prior to opening to minimize the 
loss of fine particles .  For certified values to be valid, test portion size should be based on descriptions of NIST 
methods  [7].  Results obtained should include their own estimates of uncertainty and can be compared to the certified 
values using procedures described in reference 8. 
 
Source :  SRM  1849b is a milk -based, hybrid infant/adult nutritional powder, prepared by a manufacturer of infant 
formula and adult nutritional products.  
 Analy sis:  Measurements used to value assign SRM 1849b values were performed at NIST using a variety of 
analytical techniques, by the material manufacturer, and by participants of NIST interlaboratory comparison 
studies  [7].

Non-Certified Values:   Non -certified values are suitable for use in method development, method harmonization, and 
process control but do not meet the NIST criteria for certification  [1] nor provide metrological traceability to the 
International System of Units  (SI) or other higher -order reference system.  They are the best estimates of the true 
values based on available data.  The values are provided with an uncertainty that may reflect only measurement 
reproducibility, may not include all sources of uncertainty, and/or may reflect a lack of sufficient statistical agreement 
among multiple analytical methods.
